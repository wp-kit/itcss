# ITCSS

This repo is a blank canvas file structure for scripts and styles using ITCSS methodology. 

ITCSS makes so assumptions on which framework you should use, however we recommend using a package mamager such as node, composer or bower to import your framework.

Examples of how to include the framework in the ITCSS strucutre can be found in the style.scss file.
