# ITCSS

This repo is a blank canvas file structure for scripts and styles using ITCSS methodology. It makes so assumptions on which framework you should use, however the framework you do use should live inside styles/framework with an _settings.scss and _framework.scss file.

This repo is often used as part of the [WPKit Installer](https://github.com/wp-kit/installer) repo.
