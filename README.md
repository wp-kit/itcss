# ITCSS

This repo is a blank canvas file structure for scripts and styles using [```ITCSS```](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/) methodology - using Rollup to build your CSS and JS with sourcemaps.

To install just download this repo and place within your public folder / theme etc.

We have included two example libraries, `foundation-sites` and `slick-carousel`. To install your preferred framework, just use a package manager and update the references in `styles/style.scss` and `scripts/application.js`.
